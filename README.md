# 👁️ VR-Blueprint

**VR-Blueprint** is our very first Virtual Reality game project built with Unreal Engine. It's a horror investigation game where the player explores an eerie environment, collects clues, and uncovers the story behind a mysterious event.

## 🎮 Game Concept

In this immersive horror experience, players must:
- 🔍 Explore a dark and mysterious location
- 🧠 Analyze clues and piece together the narrative
- 🎧 Experience atmospheric audio and eerie environments in full VR
- 🧩 Solve puzzles and unlock hidden story fragments

The game is built entirely using Unreal Engine Blueprints, focusing on VR interactions, storytelling, and environmental design.
